 'Preferably votes that stay on the ground.',
 'You know, I could have been a Fisherman too. Great scenery. Slimey fish.',
 "On second thought, I couldn't handle fishing. Slime doesn't work well with my gloves.",
 'If they had an official ToonFest counter though? Oh man, that would be the dream.',
 "But no, instead I'm up here in the balloon.",

 'That was complete sarcasm, too. I actually have a mortal fear of heights.',

 "One. There's actually only been one and he didn't really go sad from a crash.",
 'He worked with balloons though. So that counts.',
 "I've happened to notice that you haven't asked me to take you back down to the ground yet!",
 "I mean seriously, I'm telling you straightforward: We're not going to survive this ride.",
 "Listen, I didn't want to do this, but we're too high. This is just too high. For your own safety I'm taking us back--",
 "Oh we're here. You know, that was just as bad as anticipated, and now I get to relive it all again. Hooray!",
